Pair8,1,A,(0:02:39.1),That looks scary. Well...,8,Rebekka R
Pair8,1,B,(0:02:45.2),Or we choose 4.,8,Rebekka R
Pair8,1,A,(0:02:48.1),"4? We could try 4, because it would be dangerous or we could gain something   but I don't know what you could gain.",8,Rebekka R
Pair8,1,A,(0:03:02.9),"Uh... That's a dangerous one. No, because the arms are like down.",9,Rebekka R
Pair8,1,B,(0:03:06.2),"Yeah, really weak. And...",9,Rebekka R

Pair8,1,B,(0:07:08.7),Weak and... I think this one.,26,Rebekka R
Pair8,1,A,(0:07:11.9),"Yeah, now I don't remember if that is the one we should kill, becuase it's just there   because it's not strong, so we can't gain anything. Or if it's blue can it also be here?",26,Rebekka R
Pair8,1,B,(0:07:23.4),I think so. It's kind of friendly.,26,Rebekka R
Pair8,1,A,(0:07:25.8),Yes.,26,Rebekka R

Pair8,2,B,(0:24:09.3),I think gain.,7,Rebekka R
Pair8,2,B,(0:24:15.2),Or perhaps we just need to kill this. Or ignore it.,8,Rebekka R
Pair8,2,A,(0:24:19.4),Ignore or kill? Kill? Ignore? What do you think?,8,Rebekka R
Pair8,2,B,(0:24:25.8),In the previous we have to ignore it.,8,Rebekka R
