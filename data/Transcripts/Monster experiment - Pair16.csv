Pair16,1,A,(0:00:36.9),So is he valuable or dangerous or... None?,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:00:40.8),Uh he seems angry. Doesn't he?,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:00:42.5),Yeah.,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:00:42.6),I- I'm not sure actually. He's like two-sided.,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:00:45.6),And the body posture is also is very broad up top.,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:00:48.3),Yeah.,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:00:48.9),And uh...,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:00:50.9),Maybe like because he's going to kill us or something.,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:00:53.4),Right. Exactly.,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:00:54.4),I'm not sure.,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:00:55.4),I don't know. How do we know he is valuable or not?,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:00:58.3),Do we have to like just press in some- like choose something and then they will be explained to us?,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:01:02.8),"Oh, right. Like the feedback.",1,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:01:03.8),Yeah.,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:01:04.9),Okay. So... Are we guessing that he doesn't have the jelly?,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:01:09.7),Hmm...,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:01:09.8),So we just want to kill him and then let him lay there.,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:01:13.5),I don't know. I wonder which color is jelly. (?) blue (?).,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:01:19.6),We could try- we could try the fourth one.,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:01:21.3),Yeah. Let's do that. Okay.,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:01:30.1),He has more of a... Friendly look because-,2,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:01:33.1),Yeah! He doesn't have like eyes-,2,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:01:34.7),(?) eyes (?) back there. Right.,2,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:01:38.5),Maybe he is a good one. Or... Nuetral.,2,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:01:43.0),We could try neutral.,2,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:01:44.0),Okay.,2,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:01:52.9),"That's the same guy. Okay. We should have ignored him is what they said, right?",3,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:01:56.9),"I think he was a good one, wasn't he?",3,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:01:59.0),No they said you should have ignored this friendly alien. So yeah so-,3,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:02:03.0),Really?,3,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:02:03.7),Yeah.,3,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:02:04.3),Okay. Maybe I'm (?),3,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:02:06.5),So- so I'm guessing we have to press the one.,3,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:02:07.7),Oh yeah he's just friendly. He didn't have jelly.,3,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:02:09.4),Right.,3,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:02:14.6),And now we have- he has spots.,4,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:02:15.9),"Now he's different. Hmm. He seems like the previous one, but doesn't- this one has spots, so maybe...",4,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:02:23.9),Right. Spots are jelly?,4,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:02:25.7),I don't know.,4,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:02:26.6),Oh yeah. Good idea. Let's try that one. So like maybe two.,4,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:02:28.9),Uh yeah. Okay let's try 2.,4,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:02:36.3),That one's strong.,5,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:02:37.5),Yeah.,5,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:02:37.9),So like...,5,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:02:39.5),I don't know. The green color makes him seem more friendly.,5,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:02:42.0),Uh-huh. Maybe he's like hulk. I don't know.,5,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:02:44.8),Oh yeah! Umm... We haven't met anyone with the jelly in them.,5,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:02:53.9),No.,5,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:02:54.2),Yet.,5,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:02:54.4),I think so. No. It didn't mention it.,5,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:02:57.4),Should we try the 2?,5,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:02:59.1),Yeah.,5,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:02:59.2),And see if we can tap him.,5,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:03:02.0),Yeah maybe he's good at- yeah sure. Okay.,5,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:03:03.6),Let's try.,5,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:03:15.5),Right so the green one had the jelly in him.,6,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:03:17.3),Yep. We had this one previously. Didn't we?,6,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:03:20.5),Yeah. And he was a dangerous one.,6,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:03:25.1),Yeah... I think we... Should we kill him?,6,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:03:30.4),"Yeah. Just 3, or?",6,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:03:32.4),Yeah. Yes yes.,6,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:03:40.3),So I'm guessing all of these with the eyes like that they're friendly.,7,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:03:43.5),Mh-hmm.,7,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:03:43.9),And the guys with the eyes further apart... Um... are either to be ignored or if they have spots: dangerous.,7,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:03:50.5),Mmm.,7,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:03:52.6),I think that's the logic we're-,7,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:03:54.3),Yeah. And the green one was a good one I remember.,7,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:03:57.1),Should we try to just ignore him?,7,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:03:58.8),Yeah.,7,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:03:59.2),One?,7,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:04:00.1),Okay.,7,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:04:05.3),We had this one.,8,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:04:06.2),And he... is to be tapped.,8,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:04:09.3),With the jelly.,8,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:04:10.3),Right.,8,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:04:10.7),Yeah.,8,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:04:16.9),It's the same one?,9,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:04:17.7),Uh... Eyes further apart.,9,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:04:18.9),Yeah... Eyes are furhter.,9,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:04:20.5),So I'm guessing one of-,9,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:04:21.0),He's angry?,9,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:04:22.0),-these.,9,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:04:22.2),Yeah. Let's go him.,9,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:04:23.2),Let's kill him and then tap.,9,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:04:37.4),So maybe that both green with those eyes and those eyes are good.,10,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:04:40.0),Right. Let's- yeah. But- and he was just to be ignored.,10,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:04:43.8),Mm.,10,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:04:44.1),He was a one.,10,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:04:49.8),And he was to be tapped.,11,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:04:51.6),Now this one has spots.,11,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:04:56.5),So a 2 or a 4.,11,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:04:58.5),Um... Hmm. Do you remember with spots - was he the bad alien or good? I don't remember.,11,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:05:05.2),"Um... Not nece- I don't think so, no.",11,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:05:10.7),So 2?,11,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:05:11.3),Let's try 2.,11,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:05:11.9),Okay.,11,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:05:17.7),And he is also 2.,12,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:05:18.8),"That one is good. I remember, yeah.",12,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:05:21.8),Right?,12,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:05:22.3),Two.,12,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:05:28.8),Oh that one I don't remember.,13,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:05:30.4),Uh-huh what was he? He was to be ignored without the spots. And he now he has those spots. And I don't- now we're supposed to kill him I think. I think he is a 3.,13,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:05:42.1),Okay let's do that.,13,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:05:47.8),"That one would be two, right?",14,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:05:49.1),Uh...,14,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:05:49.3),Oh no. No the other ones were lifting their arms up.,14,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:05:53.8),Mmm.,14,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:05:54.1),This one is down so-,14,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:05:55.2),"So this is either a 1 or a 2, right?",14,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:05:57.6),Yeah. So maybe he's a good one. Just good one. So maybe just ignore.,14,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:06:00.9),So one?,14,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:06:01.4),I don't know.,14,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:06:02.9),We could try 1.,14,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:06:03.5),"Yeah, let's try.",14,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:06:09.0),And he was also a 1.,15,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:06:10.2),Mm-hmm.,15,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:06:15.3),Oh this one has oh...,16,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:06:17.1),"So he's a 2, right?",16,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:06:18.3),"Yeah. But the 2 was with the hands up, and this one is down, so down is 1.",16,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:06:22.9),Oh okay.,16,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:06:23.3),As I remember. Like can we- we can try it.,16,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:06:24.5),"Yeah yeah, do that. Yeah.",16,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:06:25.5),Okay.,16,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:06:31.9),"And he's also 1, right?",17,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:06:33.3),"Yeah, I guess so. I don't remember.",17,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:06:40.3),Hmm we didn't have that one yet.,18,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:06:43.7),Is he also 1? Or is he now dangerous since he has his arms up?,18,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:06:49.3),Is blue bad for us or good? I don't remember.,18,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:06:51.7),Blue was without the jelly anyway.,18,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:06:53.6),Mm-hmm. So maybe just ignore.,18,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:06:56.5),So I- yeah I'm thinking one of those two.,18,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:06:58.3),Mmm.,18,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:06:58.7),1 or 3. Is he threatening or not? He's a little bit more threatening with his arms.,18,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:07:03.4),Yeah I guess so. And it's this mouth like. Teeth.,18,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:07:06.2),Yeah. Should we try to kill him?,18,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:07:09.2),Yeah.,18,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:07:20.0),Um... Is he?,19,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:07:22.5),He- if he was without spots he would be one.,19,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:07:26.0),No. No then he would be uh... It's since he's green he has the jelly in him.,19,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:07:30.5),Okay.,19,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:07:31.1),So I'm thinking either 2 or 4.,19,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:07:33.9),Okay.,19,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:07:34.0),Like you said because I-I don't know with the spots if he's dangerous or not.,19,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:07:36.7),Mm. Okay let's try 4.,19,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:07:39.7),Okay.,19,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:07:46.9),"Yeah he's a 3, right?",20,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:07:48.9),"I guess so. Yeah, I think.",20,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:07:51.4),Let's try. He's either a 1 or a 3. I think he's a 3.,20,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:07:59.8),That one is green.,21,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:08:01.0),That's the one we just had.,21,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:08:02.9),Yeah so he has jelly I think.,21,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:08:06.0),Uh no they said uh... Wasn't that the one where we ignored- we should have ignored the s-,21,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:08:11.4),I think it was with spots and then it was blue.,21,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:08:13.6),Oh that- he could have been- yeah. He could have been with spots.,21,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:08:15.0),"Oh yeah yeah it was blue. Like the same on the blue. And we ignored him, like killed him, but he was with nutrience. So I would say 2.",21,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:08:21.4),So... Two?,21,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:08:23.1),Mm-hmm.,21,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:08:28.5),"And he was a 1, right?",22,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:08:30.2),Yeah.,22,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:08:30.4),The very first one we had.,22,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:08:31.2),Yeah. Mm.,22,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:08:36.8),That one is also with the nutrience.,23,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:08:38.9),With the nutrience?,23,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:08:39.8),I think.,23,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:08:40.2),I've- I've lost track.,23,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:08:41.3),Yeah I think this one is with nutrience.,23,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:08:43.6),Okay.,23,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:08:44.8),Oh okay so they're both a 1 even though they're green. And he has spots. Um...,24,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:08:54.1),I think he was with nutrience. I don't remember if he was a good one or bad one.,24,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:09:01.7),Yeah he's one of those two.,24,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:09:04.2),Mm-hmm.,24,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:09:04.9),You think he might be dangerous?,24,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:09:06.6),I'm not sure. Or maybe... I think maybe 2. I think it might be 2 or 4 with (??). I don't know.,24,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:09:14.9),Let's try 2 and see where we- okay.,24,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:09:16.5),Yeah. Let's try 2.,24,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:09:22.5),That one is green.,25,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:09:23.5),Yeah.,25,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:09:26.5),And he is with nutrience.,25,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:09:27.4),Is he with nutrience?,25,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:09:29.0),Mm. Yeah.,25,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:09:29.3),So you think he is a 2?,25,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:09:30.4),Yeah.,25,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:09:31.1),I think he might be- maybe he is a 1.,25,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:09:32.2),Really?,25,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:09:33.3),No let's try- let's try 2. And we'll see. And we'll learn.,25,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:09:34.4),Alright.,25,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:09:44.3),What was he...?,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:09:45.9),He was with nutrience. But I don't remember if he was-,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:09:48.0),Are you sure he was with nutrience?,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:09:49.8),I'm not sure. I'm just sure that green ones are nutrience.,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:09:59.1),So the blue color means 'I don't think he is with nutrience'.,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:10:06.4),Okay.,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:10:06.7),And the raised arms I think we guessed 'okay I think he might be dangerous' and I think we were wrong.,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:10:09.7),Mm.,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:10:11.2),I think maybe he is a 1.,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:10:12.3),Yeah. Yeah. I think you're right. Let's try 1.,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:10:22.1),And that guy was...,27,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:10:24.5),Maybe we mix it with the other one? So maybe that one is just the ignorable one.,27,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:10:30.9),You want to try the 1 with him?,27,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:10:32.8),Yeah. I don't know.,27,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:10:34.9),Let's try it.,27,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:10:35.5),Okay.,27,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:10:36.4),"No he just- he looks so dangerous, doesn't he?",27,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:10:38.3),I don't know.,27,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:10:40.0),You wanna try the 4 just to do something completely different?,27,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:10:42.6),Okay let's do that.,27,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:10:43.3),And then we'll learn from it.,27,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:10:50.2),So both green and blues looking the same - like with the arms and eyes and that - they're all twos.,28,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:10:56.8),Yeah.,28,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:10:56.9),Okay.,28,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:10:57.4),Right. Like. Right. Exactly. The arms like that.,28,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:10:58.9),Yeah.,28,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:11:00.1),Okay great. Nice with a memory tactic.,28,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:11:01.4),(?),28,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:11:02.9),And he's the guy with the spots. What was he? Um...,28,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:11:13.6),Was he just ignored one? Or?,28,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:11:18.7),I don't think we've had any where we were supposed to push 4.,28,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:11:21.8),Mm.,28,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:11:22.6),So I-I-I'm guessing he's one of these two. One or two. But yeah-,28,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:11:27.7),Friendly or (?),28,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:11:29.6),Either ignore him or drain him.,28,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:11:32.2),Drain him.,28,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:11:32.5),Okay let's try.,28,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:11:37.3),So first one destructive (?),29,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:11:38.5),So with the spots- but he's valuable.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:11:40.4),But now he has spots.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:11:41.9),And his arms up.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:11:42.8),Yeah but I don't remember the spots. If he was without spots he would be valuable.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:11:49.5),Um...,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:11:49.8),Um... I don't know.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:11:52.5),Okay so with- you're absolutely right - if he was without spots he would be valuable.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:11:55.6),Yeah.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:11:56.3),But now he has spots. Are we guessing he's still valuable but now dangerous?,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:11:59.8),Yeah. I would say.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:12:00.5),Or are we guessing he's still not dangerous but now not valuable either?,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:12:06.6),He is maybe valuable and dangerous. I don't know.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:12:09.4),Should we try the 4?,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:12:10.3),Yeah let's try 4.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:12:10.8),And see if this works.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:12:16.4),He was a 2.,30,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:12:16.6),That one is good. Yeah 2.,30,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:12:18.5),Yeah.,30,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:12:23.7),That one is also 2.,31,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:12:25.5),Yeah. Yeah yeah.,31,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:12:36.4),Um what was he...?,32,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:12:38.5),If he was without spots-,32,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:12:39.3),I think he is a 2.,32,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:12:41.7),"But we just had one with 2, didn't we? I think.",32,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:12:47.4),Um I think we haven't had this one in a long time. With the spots but also blue. Did we? Did we just have him?,32,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:12:54.0),We had the same green one and he was 4. So I don't know.,32,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:12:57.1),Right.,32,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:12:58.1),Maybe green ones and blue ones are the same. I don't know.,32,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:13:00.8),So either 2 or 4.,32,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:13:03.1),Yeah I would say 4.,32,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:13:04.2),Let's try 4.,32,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:13:04.6),I guess 4. I don't know.,32,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:13:09.2),Okay so like this (*hold arms up*) both with or without spots. Or with or without green are 2.,33,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:13:18.1),Yeah.,33,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:13:18.4),Except if he is the guy with the eyes apart -and then they're 4.,33,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:13:22.6),Yeah.,33,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:13:23.2),Right. And he's a 2. No. No he was... Yeah yeah he's a 2 I think.,33,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:13:30.1),But his arms are down.,33,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:13:31.4),Yeah but he was like one of the first ones.,33,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:13:33.6),I don't remember about-,33,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:13:34.4),I think he's (?).,33,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:13:38.5),So if the arms are down they're friendly. That one is 2. I remember.,34,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:13:47.2),Two.,35,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:13:52.8),"That one is a good one. We just had it, right?",36,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:13:55.5),One or two.,36,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:13:56.1),"Yeah it was 1, I guess.",36,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:13:57.9),Okay.,36,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:13:58.1),I remember.,36,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:14:04.5),And he was a-,37,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:14:07.0),-good one.,37,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:14:07.4),He's a 2. And if he had the eyes further apart he would be a 4.,37,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:14:11.5),Yeah. Exactly.,37,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:14:12.9),Despite the color.,37,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:14:15.4),I'm wondering if there is like a systematic or we're just constructing them in our head.,38,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:14:20.6),I know... Oh this one is-,38,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:14:23.1),He's a 4.,38,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:14:24.9),Yeah.,38,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:14:25.3),Right.,38,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:14:30.7),"And he's a 4 too, right?",39,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:14:31.9),Mm.,39,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:14:39.2),One?,40,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:14:39.7),Yeah (?) one.,40,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:14:40.0),I think.,40,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:14:46.7),That one is-,41,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:14:47.0),Four.,41,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:14:47.6),Yeah 4.,41,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:14:58.6),If he was without spots he would be just a good one.,42,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:15:01.8),Yeah I'm thinking he might be a 2. 'Cause he's also green with spots.,42,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:15:04.9),Alright. Or should we- I don't know.,42,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:15:09.8),You- you think we should just kill him?,42,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:15:11.6),I don't know. Let's try 2.,42,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:15:21.2),"Okay so so green, arms down with spots.",42,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:15:24.0),Mm. Yeah to remember it.,42,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:15:24.4),We'll see.,42,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:15:27.7),So both arms down with spots - without spots - green is good.,43,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:15:32.0),Yeah.,43,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:15:32.1),Yeah. Yeah.,43,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:15:33.2),And he's a 4.,43,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:15:33.9),Yeah. 4.,43,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:15:39.4),Uh that one is 2. No. Yeah.,44,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:15:42.0),"Yeah I think 2, yeah.",44,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:15:48.7),"He was the 1, right?",45,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:15:49.6),Mm.,45,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:15:49.9),We just had him.,45,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:15:59.8),His eyes are a bit different.,46,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:16:02.9),"But his arms are not, so he's not a 4...",46,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:16:04.7),Yeah. And he's not a 2.,46,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:16:06.8),So you-,46,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:16:07.1),I-I-I-I-I don't know. Maybe he's... Or maybe he's 2.,46,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:16:10.9),Should we just kill him and say we'll figure it out later?,46,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:16:12.7),Yeah. Let's (?).,46,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:16:17.2),He's the first one that we had to kill I think.,47,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:16:19.4),Yeah. And with no jelly inside of him.,47,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:16:21.0),Yeah.,47,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:16:21.4),"Yeah okay so arms down, spots-",47,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:16:23.4),Green.,47,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:16:23.9),Eyes further apart and green yeah.,47,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:16:25.5),Mm-hmm.,47,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:16:26.0),And he was a- 2 or 4.,47,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:16:29.3),I think he was... 2.,47,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:16:30.8),Yeah let's try 2. I think so too.,47,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:16:37.0),And I think he was 2 also.,48,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:16:39.0),(?),48,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:16:40.6),Oh you wanted 1?,48,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:16:41.7),"I-I think he- he was 1, wasn't he? I don't remember.",48,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:16:46.7),Um he's 1 if he's blue. But now he's green. So is he still a 1 or is he a 2?,48,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:16:53.6),His arms are down. I think he is 1.,48,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:16:56.0),Let's try 1.,48,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:17:01.8),That one is also 1. I remember the blue (?).,49,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:17:07.7),Two...,50,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:17:13.7),"A four, right?",51,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:17:15.0),Um yeah. Or 2.,51,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:17:15.7),Or no- yeah 2.,51,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:17:17.1),Because of his eyes.,51,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:17:17.6),The eyes.,51,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:17:18.2),Yeah.,51,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:17:22.8),"He's a 4, right?",52,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:17:24.1),Yeah.,52,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:17:31.2),One. I thnik.,53,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:17:33.7),Yeah. I think you're right. I think we just had him.,53,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:17:38.3),Okay so there are two which we keep on... Mixing up with each other.,54,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:17:40.0),"Yeah... So arms down, spots, but he was angry.",54,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:17:45.6),Yeah he had the eyes apart.,54,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:17:46.9),"Yeah. So spots, down-",54,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:17:48.6),So this guy was spots but blue. Right? They're- they're destructive.,54,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:17:54.6),Are they?,54,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:17:55.2),Oh no not him. But the one- the guy we just had-,54,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:17:56.5),Oh. Yeah. Like blue with spots-,54,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:17:58.2),"So if he was blue with spots he would be 3. But just like that he's one, right?",54,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:18:01.6),Mmm. Yeah.,54,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:18:02.8),1 or 2.,54,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:18:03.4),1. I think.,54,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:18:09.7),Oh... That one is dangerous. And we have to take jelly out from him.,55,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:18:11.7),"(?) Yeah. Yeah, let's do that.",55,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:18:18.6),That one... is 2.,56,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:18:19.6),"He's just a 2, right? Yeah.",56,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:18:27.2),And he was a dangerous one. Right? He is the 3.,57,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:18:31.6),Yeah I think 3.,57,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:18:35.6),And both blue and green? Or is it only blue?,58,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:18:38.6),Hmm I'm not sure. I don't remember.,58,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:18:42.0),That one's...,58,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:18:43.1),"He's a 2, right?",58,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:18:43.9),Yeah. I guess he is 2.,58,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:18:53.3),I think he is 2 as well.,59,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:18:55.9),I'm thinking a 1 or a 3.,59,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:18:57.5),Really?,59,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:18:57.6),"I don't think he has jelly, do you think so?",59,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:18:59.9),I don't know...,59,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:19:00.6),He might. It's just he's not green.,59,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:19:03.8),Hmm.,59,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:19:04.0),And a lot of the ones with the jelly are green.,59,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:19:07.6),I think green ones were with the eyes- well we- the ones that we have to kill are with the eyes like more angry.,59,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:19:14.4),Right.,59,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:19:15.0),I think maybe he is 1 then? Or 2.,59,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:19:17.9),1 or 2. Let's try 2.,59,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:19:20.1),Okay.,59,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:19:20.5),And then we'll figure it out.,59,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:19:27.3),He's-,60,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:19:27.7),He's- yeah 1.,60,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:19:28.7),Yeah.,60,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:19:36.1),Was he angry or...?,61,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:19:38.6),I think he's a 1.,61,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:19:39.7),Yeah. If he had the spots-,61,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:19:40.2),And then if he had spots he would be 3.,61,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:19:42.0),Yeah. Exactly.,61,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:19:48.2),That one is angry. So that one is 3.,62,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:19:50.4),That one is 3?,62,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:19:51.0),Yeah.,62,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:19:52.6),Okay so he was a 1. So eyes apart - he's 3. And eyes together - he's 1.,63,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:19:57.8),With the spots.,63,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:19:59.1),With the spots. Sorry. Well there are a lot of factors!,63,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:20:02.9),Yeah exactly.,63,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:20:04.0),"And he's just a 1, right?",63,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:20:05.0),Yeah. I think so.,63,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:20:10.8),And he... is a 4.,64,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:20:13.0),Yeah. 4. Because his angry eyes.,64,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:20:18.9),And the same with that one.,65,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:20:20.2),Yeah.,65,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:20:20.8),It doesn't seem that the color means that much.,66,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:20:23.1),Mm. It seems that those arms and eyes and spots mean more.,66,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:20:26.7),Yeah. Right. Um... Is he a 2?,66,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:20:31.9),I think yeah. Because he is without spots.,66,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:20:40.1),If he was blue we would have to kill him.,67,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:20:42.5),Mm.,67,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:20:43.5),But he is green. So I'm not sure.,67,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:20:45.4),I think we still have to kill him. I'm note sure.,67,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:20:46.8),Let's try.,67,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:20:48.9),Alright! So our theory about the color is not meaning anything.,68,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:20:50.2),Yeah. Nice!,68,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:20:52.4),And he's a 1.,68,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:20:53.0),Yeah.,68,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:20:58.2),Also.,69,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:21:03.8),He's a 2.,70,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:21:13.0),"He's either 1 or 3. But 3 is with the eyes angry, isn't it?",71,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:21:17.6),Yeah.,71,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:21:18.8),Maybe this one is 1.,71,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:21:20.0),"I think 1, yeah. Let's try that.",71,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:21:26.7),That one is 2. I don't know why I remember those.,72,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:21:29.1),Two?,72,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:21:29.4),Yeah.,72,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:21:30.0),Okay. I was thinking 4.,72,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:21:36.9),Okay he was 3.,73,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:21:37.2),Yeah. He's angry. Exactly.,73,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:21:42.7),That one is 2.,74,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:21:49.0),And he's a 4.,75,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:21:49.3),Four.,75,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:21:56.4),Uh I think this one is 3. Isn't it? Because he is angry.,76,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:21:59.3),Yeah.,76,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:22:05.1),That one is 4.,77,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:22:06.1),Four.,77,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:22:11.1),Also 4.,78,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:22:11.3),Four.,78,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:22:16.8),That one is 2. Or no... Yeah 2.,79,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:22:19.1),Yeah I think so.,79,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:22:24.8),One.,80,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:22:25.2),Mm-hmm.,80,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:22:31.2),He is 3.,81,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:22:32.4),Yeah. I think so too.,81,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:22:39.7),"One, right?",82,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:22:40.4),Mm.,82,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:22:45.6),Two.,83,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:22:51.7),Three.,84,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:22:52.9),Yeah. Yeah.,84,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:22:58.4),And one.,85,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:22:59.2),Yeah.,85,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:23:04.3),That one is 2.,86,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:23:09.9),"He's also 2, right?",87,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:23:10.6),Mm.,87,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:23:15.1),That one's 3.,88,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:23:16.3),Three?,88,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:23:16.7),Mm-hmm.,88,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:23:16.9),Right.,88,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:23:21.7),One.,89,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:23:27.4),He's also 1.,90,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:23:28.4),Yeah.,90,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:23:33.0),That one's 2.,91,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:23:39.5),"Still 2, right?",92,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:23:40.5),Two.,92,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:23:45.0),Still 2.,93,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:23:50.6),He's a f- no if he had spots he would be a 4.,94,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:23:52.7),Yeah. Yeah. He's a-,94,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:23:54.3),I'm not sure.,94,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:23:55.1),I think he's 2.,94,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:23:56.1),Let's try 2.,94,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:24:01.4),Uh he's a 1.,95,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:24:02.1),He's- mm-hmm.,95,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,A,(0:24:08.1),Still 1.,96,Rebekka R
Pair16,1,B,(0:24:08.6),Mm.,96,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:24:24.9),So based on what we've learned- so we have to still remember it.,97,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:24:28.6),Do we? Because we're told that-,97,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:24:29.7),Yeah but that's not yet. I don't think that's that- this is the short post-test we get to a new...,97,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:24:36.5),New session.,97,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:24:37.3),"Right. So remember what we've learned. Hmm okay we'll try. He's 1, don't you think?",97,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:24:50.3),Yeah. I think so. Because he doesn't seem angry.,97,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:24:53.9),"Right and all the others ones - when they were just one color, no spots, no anything, and arms down-",97,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:24:59.0),And eyes nice they were (?) 1s.,97,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:25:01.1),They're still 1. Right. So let's try.,97,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:25:07.6),"That one is I think like the same as 2. Because his eyes are not angry, his arms and he has spots. So I think 2.",98,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:25:15.6),Yeah. And if he would be similar to the guy with the eyes further apart he would be a 4.,98,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:25:19.5),Yeah. Exactly.,98,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:25:21.2),Right. Let's try.,98,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:25:21.5),I'm thinking what's the difference- were the eyes the same as his?,98,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:25:26.5),"Oh no now I've seen it- um... The antennas up here were larger on the other guy. Oh so these are the small antennas, so he's equivalent to the guy with the large eyes-",98,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:25:36.2),I guess so.,98,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:25:36.5),"And then there is one with eyes up here, which is the same as the guy with the antenna up here.",98,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:25:40.7),Yeah I guess so.,98,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:25:41.5),Yeah let's try. Let's see if that logic applies.,98,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:25:44.0),Okay.,98,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:25:44.6),"So 2, right?",98,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:25:45.5),Mm.,98,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:25:51.7),Um I think it's also-,99,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:25:53.1),One... Two?,99,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:25:53.8),Two. Yeah I think so.,99,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:26:01.2),That one is angry. I think. And he has nutrience now. Because he has-,100,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:26:05.8),But yeah he has spots.,100,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:26:06.6),Spots. He seems angry and his arms are down.,100,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:26:10.1),"But he's... So he's a 2, right?",100,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:26:12.1),Or...,100,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:26:13.0),I'm thinking if his arms were- oh yeah it's either 3- like the one guy we were supposed to kill without getting anything-,100,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:26:18.2),Yeah... Yeah I think it was 3.,100,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:26:20.5),Yeah let's try that.,100,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:26:21.2),But how did 4 look? Was his arms up?,100,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:26:22.9),4s were up.,100,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:26:24.1),Yeah exactly.,100,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:26:24.7),And also- only eyes apart.,100,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:26:26.7),Mmm.,100,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:26:27.5),If the eyes were together then it was just a 2. So are we gonna just kill him?,100,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:26:32.2),Yeah I think. I think.,100,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:26:39.3),So he's a 4.,101,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:26:40.2),Mm. Because he is angry.,101,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:26:46.8),That one's-,102,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:26:48.0),I think a 2.,102,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:26:48.5),Two. Yeah.,102,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:26:54.5),And a 4. Cause the eyes are apart.,103,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:26:56.4),Mm. Yeah. So (?) the spots,103,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:26:57.1),So regardless of the color- exactly.,103,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:27:04.5),I don't remember if he's a 1 or a 2.,104,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:27:07.4),I think he's- I was thinking like he wanted 3.,104,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:27:12.6),"Uh yeah. Who did we just kill? No, he was the guy with the eyes apart that was a 3.",104,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:27:17.1),Yeah.,104,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:27:17.8),The eyes together was never to be killed. So...,104,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:27:20.8),Maybe he's 1.,104,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:27:22.4),1 or- should we just try 1?,104,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:27:24.3),I don't know.,104,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:27:25.4),I think it's 1 or 2.,104,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:27:26.5),Okay.,104,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,A,(0:27:26.8),We can try 1.,104,Rebekka R
Pair16,1a,B,(0:27:28.1),Okay let's try 1.,104,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:27:49.4),Now how do we know? We cannot just- probably we shouldn't use the same so. In the- okay we have to forget it.,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:27:57.2),But that's really hard.,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:27:58.2),Yeah it is kinda hard.,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:28:02.3),Um but I'm guessing that we're gonna have to learn the new system by just you know (?),1,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:28:07.4),Exactly. So it's random.,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:28:09.1),Guess and then- so maybe 2?,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:28:11.6),Yeah.,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:28:11.6),And then we'll see if we're right.,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:28:17.7),Same one.,2,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:28:18.2),Same one. 2.,2,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:28:20.0),Okay so arms were- no- did he have spots? I didn't get it.,3,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:28:23.4),No I think he was exactly the same. Wasn't he?,3,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:28:27.0),That's the- that was what I thought. I don't know.,3,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:28:28.9),Oh my god.,3,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:28:29.8),But he couldn't have been.,3,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:28:32.1),Uh. Probably we just missed something.,3,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:28:37.8),Okay so previously he would be a 4.,3,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:28:40.0),But now... Hmm.,3,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:28:43.1),Should we just try 4 again?,3,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:28:43.7),Yeah. Let's try.,3,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:28:49.6),"He has arms down. A 2, maybe?",4,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:28:53.2),Okay.,4,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:28:53.8),And then- cause like the guy with the arms down with the eyes further apart and green and with spots. The only difference is that the eyes apart or not.,4,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:28:58.9),Mm. Okay let's try.,4,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:29:01.8),"And he was a 2, so we can see if he is too.",4,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:29:09.5),"That one was a good one with nutrience, but now (?)",5,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:29:12.9),"Was he with- yeah. I'm thinking. I'm thinking if we have to start all over he would maybe be one of these, cause he looks so angry.",5,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:29:19.7),Yeah. Maybe 4? I'm not sure.,5,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:29:25.0),Go ahead.,5,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:29:32.1),So big eyes no spots was a 3. And him as a green was a 4 earlier. Should we try 4 again?,6,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:29:43.0),"Yeah I think we guessed right when he was green, wasn't it?",6,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:29:46.0),I think so.,6,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:29:51.9),"That one previously was good one with nutrience, but now I'm not...",7,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:29:55.1),"Yeah we just had him in blue, and-",7,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:29:57.2),He was 3.,7,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:29:58.4),No he was big eyes. The one we- should we try 3? And see?,7,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:30:02.3),Yeah. Yeah let's try.,7,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:30:07.5),So regardless of eye-size and color they're destructive.,8,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:30:09.5),They're destructive.,8,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:30:11.9),Right. Should we try 1 again and see?,8,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:30:13.8),Okay.,8,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:30:22.2),Should we try 2?,9,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:30:23.6),Yeah we can.,9,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:30:31.9),Are we guessing he's a 2 also?,10,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:30:33.1),Mm. Maybe eyes doesn't matter. Let's try 2.,10,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:30:44.2),The color changed.,11,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:30:45.0),Maybe 2 as well?,11,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:30:47.1),Le's try.,11,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:30:53.3),I think that one was destructive.,12,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:30:55.3),Yeah.,12,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:30:55.9),(?) he wasn't nutrience?,12,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:30:57.4),No I think you're right he was a 3. Yeah.,12,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:30:59.2),I think so.,12,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:30:59.6),Yeah.,12,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:31:04.5),"Okay so if he's blue he's 3, and if he's green he's 4.",13,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:31:08.7),Green - 4. Okay.,13,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:31:10.0),With big eyes. And he was just a 1. I'm pretty sure.,13,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:31:22.5),And he was a 2. I think we just had him earlier I think he's a 2.,14,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:31:26.5),Okay.,14,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:31:31.9),I think he's a 1.,15,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:31:32.5),Yeah 1.,15,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:31:40.5),I think he's a 1 or 3. I don't know why.,16,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:31:43.3),A 3?,16,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:31:45.1),I'm not sure.,16,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:31:45.8),I think he's a 1 or a 2.,16,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:31:51.0),Hm.,16,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:31:52.7),"I think we just had him, but I don't remember- I think he was one of the ones we guessed right. So we haven't memorised him. Memorised the difference.",16,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:32:02.8),Uh maybe nutrience?,16,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:32:05.2),Two?,16,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:32:05.4),Yeah.,16,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:32:06.2),Let's try 2.,16,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:32:08.7),Okay so he's a 1. Regardless of spots or not. And he's a 2.,17,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:32:14.1),Is he?,17,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:32:14.4),Yeah.,17,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:32:14.6),Okay.,17,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:32:17.4),"Oh those are friendly. Okay spots, arms down, no matter what eyes (?)-",18,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:32:22.7),Yeah then it's 1.,18,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:32:23.8),Exactly.,18,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:32:24.1),"And then spots it's 2. So he's a 1 also, right?",18,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:32:27.9),Mm-hmm.,18,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:32:34.1),Was he a 3? Or did he need spots for that?,19,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:32:38.2),I think he's 3 or 4.,19,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:32:42.5),Uh I think he needs spots to be a 4. I think we should just kill him.,19,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:32:45.5),Mm. Okay just kill him.,19,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:32:51.5),I think that was-,20,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:32:52.9),Yeah.,20,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:32:53.6),1 or 2.,20,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:32:53.7),This one is the 2. And if he didn't have spots he'd be a 1.,20,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:32:59.0),Yeah. Because- or wasn't it the color?,20,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:33:02.0),Was it?,20,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:33:02.8),I think it was maybe blue... Blue was good...,20,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:33:07.0),Yeah blue and green- was that it?,20,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:33:09.5),Yeah I think-,20,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:33:10.2),Well then it's still a 2.,20,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:33:10.8),Mm.,20,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:33:23.9),"Um but he's a 1, right?",21,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:33:25.8),Yeah.,21,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:33:31.5),"Also 1, isn't it? Because- or 2?",22,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:33:35.4),I have no idea anymore.,22,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:33:38.0),I think he's also 1.,22,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:33:39.5),Let's try.,22,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:33:39.9),I don't know why.,22,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:33:41.0),"Let's try 1. Okay so he's green no spots. And we just had one with big eyes, green, with spots, and that was 1.",22,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:33:49.5),Wasn't it blue with the? Just just the one before- wasn't he blue? I think he was blue with spots.,22,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:33:57.8),No he was green.,22,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:33:58.9),Oh my god...,22,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:33:59.7),With spots. And big eyes. And he was a 1.,22,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:34:02.5),Okay.,22,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:34:03.0),"So if he is friendly, this guy is definitely friendly, right?",22,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:34:04.9),Mm. Okay let's try.,22,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:34:11.6),So no spots is 2 regardless of color. Should we try out that rule?,23,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:34:17.1),Okay.,23,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:34:17.3),And see if it works.,23,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:34:18.0),Let's do that. So color-,23,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:34:19.5),"So color doesn't matter, but spots matter. So spots is-",23,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:34:24.3),Is good.,23,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:34:25.1),Is 2.,23,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:34:25.7),But but- is it? I think we just had one without spots and he was 2.,23,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:34:30.2),And he was also a 2.,23,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:34:31.6),Yeah so without spots is 2. With spots is 1. Isn't it?,23,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:34:37.1),But. I don't think there is a system. Oh I have no idea. He's a 4. No.,23,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:34:42.4),Okay yeah I think it's 4.,23,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:34:42.8),Yeah 4. Right? He is a 4.,23,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:34:45.4),Yeah. Because he was-,23,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:34:51.2),And he was also 4.,24,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:34:51.4),He's the same.,24,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:34:52.8),Yeah.,24,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:34:59.1),He's a 1. Right?,25,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:35:03.3),Or 2.,25,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:35:08.9),I think he is a 1. You think he is a 2?,25,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:35:11.3),Uh-huh. I don't know.,25,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:35:12.1),We'll try 2.,25,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:35:13.9),"No, you were right!",26,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:35:15.9),So he was blue with no spots.,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:35:20.1),But green one without spots was 2.,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:35:22.2),Yeah.,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:35:22.8),So maybe color matters.,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:35:24.3),But we had- no they were both with. Okay. If color matters then green is 2. And blue is 1.,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:35:33.1),Yeah I think.,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:35:34.0),Okay. We'll try. And he's a 4.,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:35:38.5),Yeah. Or 3. Because his eyes are not angry.,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:35:43.3),Right. Is he 3?,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:35:46.2),I'm not sure. I don't know.,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:35:54.6),Let's try.,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:36:00.9),Okay so we just said that green was 2 and blue was 1. Should we test that theory?,27,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:36:07.6),Yeah. I think so.,27,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:36:12.1),Oh my god it's getting difficult. He was with spots and he was blue. And he was nutrience.,28,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:36:18.0),Yeah. And the guy with the eyes apart was different with the colors. Maybe they switch depending on if it's big eyed or small eyed. Whether the green is 2 or 1.,28,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:36:27.8),Mm.,28,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:36:33.2),"I'm kinda doubting myself if I'm making it more complicated than it has to be. But he's a 1, right?",28,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:36:38.2),Yeah. I think so.,28,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:36:39.7),Is that our guess?,28,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:36:40.7),I think yeah.,28,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:36:45.3),Okay okay okay I got it now. So big eyes means green's-,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:36:50.4),"So that is like that? Like friendly, or?",29,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:36:53.5),No no. Uh small-small eye- this guy. Eyes wide apart is... Um blue and green. And eyes tight together is the other way around.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:37:06.7),Mm-hmm.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:37:07.0),So green and blue.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:37:10.1),Green and blue.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:37:11.7),Um. So that's really easy to get mixed up.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:37:14.3),Mm. I'm thinking it's 2. Or 1. 2.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:37:18.9),Yeah let's. I think he's 2.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:37:23.1),Okay.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:37:23.8),And then if he had been eyes together-,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:37:27.3),It would be 1.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:37:27.5),It would be 1. I think so.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:37:29.2),Okay let's try.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:37:39.8),Eyes wide... Bkue.,30,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:37:42.1),Are we guessing 1?,30,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:37:44.5),Green is 2?,30,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:37:44.6),The green guy was 2. With eyes wide apart.,30,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:37:46.0),Mm. Oh so you think it's opposite now.,30,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:37:49.3),So I think maybe he might be a 1.,30,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:37:51.8),Okay.,30,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:37:52.7),Cause he is blue. I think he might be 1.,30,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:37:55.4),Okay let's try 1.,30,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:37:59.0),So-,31,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:38:00.1),"Wide eyes, no matter what color, is 2.",31,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:38:03.7),Yeah.,31,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:38:05.0),Probably.,31,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:38:05.5),Yeah. ,31,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:38:06.1),"And probably close eyes, no matter what color, is 1.",31,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:38:09.1),We can try that.,31,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:38:09.7),Okay let's try that.,31,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:38:09.9),We'll see. And what is he?,31,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:38:12.8),And this one is maybe one of those two?,31,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:38:16.4),"Yeah I'm thinking maybe the 3, yeah.",31,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:38:18.9),Yeah I think it is also 3.,31,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:38:25.4),So regardless of spots or not the guy with the arms like this is 4.,32,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:38:28.7),Mm. Is dangerous.,32,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:38:30.3),So should we try that we him?,32,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:38:33.4),Okay.,32,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:38:36.9),Maybe the same with eyes.,33,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:38:39.2),No they had different eyes.,33,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:38:40.5),Did they?,33,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:38:41.0),Yeah. The first guy had eyes wide apart and the second had big eyes close together.,33,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:38:47.8),"But the one that had that eyes was 4, and the one with close eyes was that.",33,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:38:53.2),"I totally lost track now. Should we just like try to completely start over, and..? I don't- we can't do that. Okay. So this guy anyway. He's... a 2. Right?",33,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:39:11.0),Yeah. I think so.,33,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:39:12.4),It's a green. Wide apart.,33,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:39:14.0),Mm. No-,33,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:39:15.7),No spots.,33,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:39:24.5),Now he's another color but with spots.,34,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:39:27.4),I'm thinking he's still 2. I don't know why.,34,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:39:34.0),So that was what you said earlier: like wide eyes is always a 2.,35,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:39:36.5),Mmm. Mm-hmm.,35,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:39:38.4),But now he has his arms up.,35,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:39:39.4),And arms are down. If arms are up it's either of those two.,35,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:39:43.1),Right.,35,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:39:44.3),Okay.,35,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:39:44.6),I'm thinking if it's um- I think maybe he is a 3.,35,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:39:50.1),Three?,35,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:39:50.4),Yeah. I think if he had spots he would be a 4.,35,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:39:53.6),Okay let's try 4- uh 3.,35,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:39:58.5),So (?) his spots- so maybe also 3?,36,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:40:01.9),Yeah. Let's try.,36,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:40:04.1),So if they have spots they're 4. So 4.,37,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:40:08.0),Yeah.,37,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:40:13.2),And 4.,38,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:40:13.5),Also 4.,38,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:40:18.9),I think also 4.,39,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:40:19.1),"Try 4, yeah.",39,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:40:24.8),Um... I think he's 2. Cause his eyes are wide.,40,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:40:28.3),Yeah. Yeah.,40,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:40:35.7),Okay he's a 4.,41,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:40:37.4),Yeah.,41,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:40:43.3),Um... He's either 1 or 2.,42,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:40:46.3),Yeah.,42,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:40:46.5),Because his arms are down.,42,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:40:48.8),I completely lost track of which ones are 1 and 2 now.,42,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:40:52.2),Maybe with spots- I don't know I think he- spots means jelly. I'll do 2.,42,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:40:59.3),We can try... 2.,42,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:41:06.2),I think also 2. Because he's almost the same.,43,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:41:08.1),Yeah.,43,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:41:13.1),I'm (?) without spots I think 3.,44,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:41:14.1),"(?) three, yeah.",44,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:41:20.2),And 3.,45,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:41:20.5),Also 3.,45,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:41:21.2),Yeah.,45,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:41:30.7),This one is... 1?,47,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:41:34.8),1 or 2.,47,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:41:36.2),"Yeah 1. Without spots, close eyes is 1.",48,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:41:41.2),Yeah.,48,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:41:41.4),Yeah like this one. I think.,48,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:41:42.9),He's also one.,48,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:41:43.9),Yeah.,48,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:41:44.3),"So without spots is 1, and with spots is 2.",49,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:41:48.2),Mm.,49,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:41:48.6),Okay. And he's a 4.,49,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:41:51.4),Okay.,49,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:41:55.5),He was a 3.,50,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:41:56.4),It depends on the eyes?,50,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:41:58.5),"It might. What did we say- we said that 2 was with spots and 1 was without, so let's try 1.",50,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:42:05.5),Mm. Let's try 1.,50,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:42:09.7),So wide eyes is always... 2? Maybe?,51,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:42:13.9),Spots doesn't matter?,51,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:42:15.8),Does spots matter with him then?,51,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:42:19.6),This one is (?). Is he 1 or a 2?,51,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:42:23.0),You wanna try... I don't know.,51,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:42:27.1),"I'm not sure. I'm afraid to try. 1, 2...",51,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:42:32.3),Try 1.,51,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:42:32.8),Okay.,51,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:42:33.0),And then we'll see.,51,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:42:37.6),So eyes close together is a 2 if he's green.,52,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:42:43.2),I just pressed 1 now.,52,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:42:44.8),But he was blue.,52,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:42:46.1),Was he?,52,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:42:48.7),Okay so I think eyes close together if he's blue he's always 1-,52,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:42:52.7),Uh-huh.,52,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:42:52.8),And if he's green he's 2. And eyes wide apart is always... 2 unless he's...,52,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:43:02.9),Uh I don't know.,52,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:43:06.0),Yeah I don't know. We'll-,52,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:43:07.9),He's a... 3?,52,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:43:08.5),3. Yeah.,52,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:43:17.9),He's a 2.,53,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:43:19.3),Okay let's try.,53,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:43:28.1),He's 4?,54,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:43:28.7),He's 4 yeah.,54,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:43:34.5),Also 4?,55,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:43:34.7),Also 4 yeah.,55,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:43:39.9),I think he's the-,56,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:43:40.2),Three.,56,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:43:40.8),Yeah.,56,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:43:42.5),Okay okay so regardless of spots...,57,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:43:46.9),But then what's matter? Maybe eyes.,57,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:43:50.4),Or or big arms whether they're up or down. I think if they're down it's a 3. I think if they're up it's a 4 regardless of spots. I think he's a 4.,57,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:43:59.2),Okay let's try.,57,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:44:01.6),Okay no. That was my only guess.,58,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:44:04.8),That one is 3. I guess.,58,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:44:07.1),Try.,58,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:44:08.7),"So no spots no matter what- no matter color. Also 3, I guess.",59,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:44:14.7),Yeah.,59,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:44:19.2),That one is 4.,60,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:44:19.9),Yeah.,60,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:44:24.9),Three.,61,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:44:30.3),It's a 1 or 2.,62,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:44:34.7),Yeah.,62,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:44:36.3),I don't know. Maybe 1?,62,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:44:37.7),I think we say- yeah let's try 1.,62,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:44:39.9),"And then if he would be- if he was green, no matter if he has spots or not, he would be a 2. I think maybe. He's a 4, right?",63,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:44:50.5),"Yeah. I think so, yeah.",63,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:44:57.5),Either 1 or 2.,64,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:44:58.4),I think he's a 1. And if he was green he'd be a 2. I think 1.,64,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:45:08.9),So I think those eyes- if the eyes are-,65,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:45:12.5),-are wide apart-,65,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:45:13.0),-wide then it's 2. And if it- it doesn't matter if it has spots.,65,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:45:16.5),Mm. Try 2.,65,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:45:22.8),"So wide- eyes wide apart, no spots, arms down-",66,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:45:27.2),And with spots as well. I think.,66,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:45:29.4),Yeah.,66,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:45:29.9),... Is 2.,66,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:45:30.9),"So the only time we press 1, with his eyes wide apart, is if he's green. No spots.",66,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:45:38.5),I think so.,66,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:45:39.2),No then he would also be a 2.,66,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:45:41.1),I think only- when eyes are like that and arms are like that it's 1.,66,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:45:44.1),Yeah. Yeah.,66,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:45:45.4),Okay. Let's try.,66,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:45:51.0),He's a 2. He's the same guy,67,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:45:53.9),Oh my god but why?,67,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:45:55.0),Um because he has spots.,67,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:45:56.6),You think?,67,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:45:57.5),And eyes are close together.,67,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:45:58.9),And if he was without spots he would be 1?,67,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:46:01.0),I think so.,67,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:46:01.7),Okay let's press it.,67,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:46:04.0),"But the eyes wide apart is always a 2, I think. I think he's a 3, right?",68,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:46:09.5),Yeah I think so too.,68,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:46:16.6),So I'm thinking he's a 2. Cause eyes wide apart.,69,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:46:19.3),Yeah. I think so too.,69,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:46:25.4),This one is... 3?,70,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:46:29.1),Yeah but wasn't there something earlier about regardless of them having spots or not they would be a 4? Let's try- I- we'll try 3.,70,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:46:37.7),(?),70,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:46:38.8),"3, yeah.",70,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:46:44.0),And he's a... 1?,71,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:46:46.7),"1, yeah.",71,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:46:52.8),I think he's a 2 now.,72,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:46:54.0),Okay let's try.,72,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:47:00.3),I think 3.,73,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:47:01.6),Yeah that one is 3.,73,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:47:08.1),He's 4.,74,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:47:08.2),Three?,74,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:47:08.8),I think he's 4.,74,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:47:09.5),4? I think his eyes have to be (*makes hand movement*),74,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:47:10.9),Since he has spots. Okay.,74,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:47:13.9),I'm I'm not sure.,74,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:47:15.9),"Okay. But yeah there were some exception to the rule that we had made in the first session, but yeah that might be it - the eyes. That this one is only for the eyes wide apart.",74,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:47:23.9),Mm.,74,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:47:24.0),"That's what you're thinking, right?",74,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:47:25.1),Uh-huh.,74,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:47:25.5),We can try. So try 3.,74,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:47:27.0),Okay. Let's try.,74,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:47:31.4),So I'm thinking now... This one is only for eyes wide apart.,75,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:47:35.4),Mm.,75,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:47:36.3),And this one is only for eyes close together. But I don't know if he's a 1 or a 2.,75,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:47:45.1),Yeah because it depends on the color probably. I don't know. 1 or 2.,75,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:47:53.7),I see- should we just try 1 and see if all close eyes are just 1?,75,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:47:57.0),Okay.,75,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:47:59.7),So close eyes- if they're bl- I think this one is only for close eyes if they're blue.,76,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:48:05.2),Mm.,76,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:48:05.7),I think maybe.,76,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:48:06.7),Yeah because they worked all the time before.,76,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:48:08.2),"Yeah. I think so. Yeah. So he's a 4, right?",76,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:48:12.1),Yeah.,76,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:48:12.6),Cause eyes are wide apart.,76,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:48:17.0),That one's 3.,77,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:48:17.7),Yeah.,77,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:48:25.1),I think he's a 2.,78,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:48:26.0),Two.,78,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:48:31.8),This is 1.,79,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:48:32.2),"1, yeah.",79,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:48:34.0),So is it just that-,80,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:48:35.6),Without spots it's just simple one.,80,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:48:36.6),"Yeah, yeah. That might be it.",80,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:48:39.4),"3, isn't it?",80,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:48:40.6),Yeah.,80,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:48:49.2),This is 1.,81,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:48:49.9),Yeah.,81,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:48:56.7),I think he's 2.,82,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:48:57.2),His (arms?)- yeah. I think so.,82,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:49:04.4),Arms up. 3.,83,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:49:06.7),3. Yeah.,83,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:49:12.7),3 as well.,84,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:49:12.9),Yeah. Yeah.,84,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:49:18.8),Two.,85,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:49:18.8),One.,85,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:49:20.0),Two. Because if his eyes were close together-,85,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:49:21.3),Oh. Yeah. (?),85,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:49:24.6),Yeah.,85,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:49:28.9),Three.,86,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:49:29.3),Three.,86,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:49:33.6),"He had arms up, no spots.",87,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:49:34.9),You sure without spots? He was green.,87,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:49:36.7),Yeah. I don't know. He's a 3.,87,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:49:40.1),Yeah.,87,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:49:40.3),Cause his eyes are... Wide.,87,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:49:45.8),This one is 3 as well.,88,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:49:47.0),Yeah.,88,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:49:55.6),Four. Isn't it?,89,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:49:57.3),Yeah.,89,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:50:05.2),Four.,90,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:50:05.4),"I would've 3, but we just got a few wrong and I'm not sure which rule to (?)",90,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:50:11.0),Maybe eyes. Let's try 4.,90,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:50:13.2),We can try 4.,90,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:50:16.4),"Is it like um- clos- like big eyes like this is 1 and 3, and eyes wide apart is 2 and 4?",91,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:50:24.6),Mm.,91,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:50:24.9),Is that it?,91,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:50:25.6),I think so.,91,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:50:29.8),But he has spots.,91,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:50:31.2),Exactly. So I'm thinking he is 1 or 2. Maybe 2?,91,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:50:39.2),We can try 2. Yeah.,91,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:50:41.5),Okay okay so that must be it then. That eyes wide apart like that is-,92,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:50:46.1),-2 or 4.,92,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:50:46.8),Right.,92,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:50:47.5),And the other way around (?) 3.,92,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:50:49.5),Regardless of spots and color. Yeah let's try that.,92,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:50:52.4),Okay. So 4?,92,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:50:53.4),Yeah.,92,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:50:58.4),And...,93,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:50:59.1),One.,93,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:50:59.9),Yeah.,93,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:51:04.7),And 2. Right?,94,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:51:05.3),Two. I guess.,94,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:51:10.8),And 3.,95,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:51:11.3),3 yeah.,95,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:51:17.6),I'm still thinking he has to be a 3.,96,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:51:20.6),This one?,96,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:51:21.2),Yeah.,96,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,B,(0:51:22.3),Okay.,96,Rebekka R
Pair16,2,A,(0:51:22.4),"And then if he had spots like the earlier one did, then it would be 4.",96,Rebekka R
Pair16,2a,A,(0:51:39.5),Arms- he's a 4. No he's a 2.,97,Rebekka R
Pair16,2a,B,(0:51:42.8),Yeah. I think he's 2.,97,Rebekka R
Pair16,2a,A,(0:51:44.0),Cause eyes wide apart-,97,Rebekka R
Pair16,2a,B,(0:51:45.2),And arms down.,97,Rebekka R
Pair16,2a,A,(0:51:46.4),Right.,97,Rebekka R
Pair16,2a,B,(0:51:51.1),Arms up. And without spots. Maybe 3? Or 4?,98,Rebekka R
Pair16,2a,A,(0:51:55.7),I think maybe 3.,98,Rebekka R
Pair16,2a,B,(0:51:57.0),Okay I'll also go for 3.,98,Rebekka R
Pair16,2a,A,(0:52:02.5),"And he's a 2, right? No he's big eyed. But he's with spots - I think he is 2.",99,Rebekka R
Pair16,2a,B,(0:52:09.0),I think so too.,99,Rebekka R
Pair16,2a,B,(0:52:14.7),That must be 1.,100,Rebekka R
Pair16,2a,A,(0:52:16.3),I think yeah.,100,Rebekka R
Pair16,2a,A,(0:52:21.3),"He's a 4, right?",101,Rebekka R
Pair16,2a,B,(0:52:22.3),Mm.,101,Rebekka R
Pair16,2a,B,(0:52:27.3),He's also 4?,102,Rebekka R
Pair16,2a,A,(0:52:28.6),Yeah.,102,Rebekka R
Pair16,2a,A,(0:52:34.5),Big eyes-,103,Rebekka R
Pair16,2a,B,(0:52:35.2),Three.,103,Rebekka R
Pair16,2a,A,(0:52:35.6),Yeah.,103,Rebekka R
Pair16,2a,A,(0:52:41.4),But now he has spots.,104,Rebekka R
Pair16,2a,B,(0:52:44.2),I think it's also 3. Or 4.,104,Rebekka R
Pair16,2a,A,(0:52:46.5),I think maybe 4.,104,Rebekka R
Pair16,2a,B,(0:52:48.8),Okay let's try 4.,104,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:53:01.4),We can just randomly guess.,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:53:02.9),Right. And then we'll learn from the guesses.,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:53:04.3),Yeah.,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:53:05.0),Okay. So...,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:53:06.1),Blue...,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:53:07.3),Arms down with spots.,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:53:10.7),Eyes wide apart.,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:53:11.6),Should we try to guess 2? And we'll see?,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:53:13.9),Yeah we can.,1,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:53:18.9),So spots doesn't mean dangerous if the arms are down.,2,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:53:22.0),Mm.,2,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:53:23.0),Okay. Should we- is he a 1 or a 2?,2,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:53:25.9),Maybe a 1?,2,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:53:26.3),Try 1.,2,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:53:26.7),Yeah I'll go for 1.,2,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:53:28.3),Good! So the differene there was the um...,3,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:53:32.6),Eyes.,3,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:53:32.7),The eyes. And the spots.,3,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:53:34.5),Exactly. Arms up. So maybe it's 3 or 4 like last.,3,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:53:38.9),Maybe 3. And then if he had spots he might be a 4.,3,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:53:42.1),Yeah maybe.,3,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:53:46.9),"So he was a 4, but he didn't have any spots.",4,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:53:49.5),"Mm. So maybe like spots, spots, without spots, without spots (*points at screen*). I don't know.",4,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:53:56.3),That could be.,4,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:53:57.8),Okay so maybe if that works- if he is a 1...,4,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:54:00.4),Mm.,4,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:54:00.7),Okay let's try.,4,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:54:06.0),And then he would be a 2.,5,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:54:06.6),Two.,5,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:54:12.2),"So he would be... Thr- no. Did we say these were with spots, or these were with spots?",6,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:54:18.0),I think those were with spots.,6,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:54:19.7),So he would be a 4.,6,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:54:20.6),Yeah I thinking he was 4.,6,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:54:24.6),He was a 1?,7,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:54:26.8),Yeah he was 1.,7,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:54:27.7),But he had his arms up.,7,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:54:28.9),Exactly! So maybe his arms up/down-,7,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:54:33.5),No- arms up/down no spots regardless of eyes.,7,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:54:36.3),And color.,7,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:54:40.9),So that one is like everything without spots?,7,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:54:43.6),Hmm... Trying to understand.,7,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:54:49.7),I would say he was a 2.,7,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:54:53.3),Okay. Let's try.,7,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:54:53.6),And then we can... Yeah.,7,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:55:01.8),Maybe it's 4?,8,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:55:02.9),Yeah. Try 4.,8,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:55:06.1),"So spots, arms up, 4.",9,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:55:10.4),Then he would be a 1. Cause he doesn't have any spots. And he does (?) big arms.,9,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:55:14.8),Yeah. I think so.,9,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:55:20.8),"So that was the same guy that was a 1, right?",10,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:55:24.4),Mm.,10,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:55:25.0),I think he's a 1.,10,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:55:26.1),I think so too.,10,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:55:34.6),Is he a 3 or a 4?,11,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:55:35.8),Yeah I think he's 3 then. Cause he's with spots.,11,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:55:38.6),Okay.,11,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:55:42.6),"So it's spots, and without spots...",12,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:55:45.6),"Try to see if he's a 3 or a 4. Cause that's the same one- exact same one, but he's blue.",12,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:55:49.5),I think he is 4 then.,12,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:55:51.3),Yeah try.,12,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:56:03.1),Is he 1?,13,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:56:05.3),I think yeah.,13,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:56:12.7),He's a 2. No. He might be a 1.,14,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:56:15.3),Maybe 1?,14,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:56:15.6),Yeah try 1.,14,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:56:22.0),And he's also a 1.,15,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:56:22.5),One.,15,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:56:24.8),What was the difference?,16,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:56:25.9),I didn't see. I think- maybe arms were up. Like (?),16,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:56:30.1),No. No.,16,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:56:31.9),The arms were up now?,16,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:56:32.9),I don't think so.,16,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:56:34.1),"I think this one was arms down, but the previous one was up.",16,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:56:36.9),Okay. Okay.,16,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:56:38.1),"So... Arms up is this one, and arms down is that one. I'm not sure.",16,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:56:47.9),"But he's a 1, right?",16,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:56:49.3),Yeah. He's 1.,16,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:56:49.6),No. No. Is he?,16,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:56:52.8),I don't know.,16,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:56:53.8),"Such a brain scramble. He's a 1 or a 3, right? Or a 1 or a 4?",16,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:57:03.8),Maybe 1. I don't know.,16,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:57:05.6),Try 1. Go ahead.,16,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:57:06.0),Okay let's try.,16,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:57:09.2),And you said earlier: arms down is that one and that one. Okay. So he is a... 3 or a 4.,17,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:57:19.9),Maybe 3?,17,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:57:23.4),I think he might be a 4.,17,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:57:25.0),Okay let's try.,17,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:57:25.6),You think he's a 3?,17,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:57:26.9),I don't know. Yeah. But okay let's just try 4.,17,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:57:29.5),Just try one of them and we'll see.,17,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:57:31.4),"He's a 4. He had arms up and spots. And that's the same guy, but arms down. No but he also had small arms - not the muscle arms. That's also one of the things.",18,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:57:44.0),You think-,18,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:57:46.0),I think maybe he's a 2.,18,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:57:47.6),Yeah I would say 2.,18,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:57:52.7),Also 2.,19,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:57:53.3),Also 2 yeah.,19,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:57:59.2),So he's a 4.,20,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:58:00.8),Is he?,20,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:58:02.8),Well isn't that the one we just had?,20,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:58:04.6),I don't remember.,20,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:58:06.7),I think he's a 4. Yeah.,20,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:58:07.8),Okay let's try.,20,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:58:15.4),"Eyes close, blue, spots, arms up.",21,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:58:20.3),If he didn't have spots he'd be a 1. Right?,21,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:58:26.0),I think so.,21,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:58:26.8),I'm thinking maybe because he has spots he might be a 2.,21,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:58:29.1),Let's try.,21,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:58:34.4),So big eyes is that like 1 no matter what?,22,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:58:38.1),I guess so. So let's try 1 on that one.,22,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:58:39.8),Yeah.,22,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:58:45.7),So 1 I guess.,23,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:58:46.4),Mm.,23,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:58:48.6),So he's a destructive one.,24,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:58:49.8),"Oh my god. Okay. Green one, (eyes?) up.",24,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:58:54.5),"He's a 4, right?",24,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:58:56.3),"Think so, yeah.",24,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:59:02.9),"Is it like the muscle arms, or?",25,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:59:07.2),I think all the arms that are up are muscle. Aren't they?,25,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:59:10.8),No sometimes they have big muscles down here.,25,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:59:12.7),Really?,25,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:59:13.2),Yeah. But. And also sometimes they have thin arms even though they're raised.,25,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:59:20.0),Uh-huh. Oh my god.,25,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:59:22.4),"But he is a 3, right?",25,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:59:26.9),I'm not sure anymore. But okay let's try.,25,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:59:31.5),He's a 1. But his eyes were far apart.,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:59:34.0),Why?,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:59:35.7),He is... I don't know.,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:59:41.0),"I'm totally lost. Arms up, maybe a 1.",26,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:59:51.6),But he has the big arms. I think maybe the big arms means he's one of these.,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:59:54.9),Four.,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(0:59:55.7),Yeah. We could try 4.,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(0:59:57.6),Okay let's try 4.,26,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:00:09.3),"And he is a 2 also, I think.",27,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:00:13.5),Okay. Let's try. Why why is he-,27,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:00:15.9),"Um. Yeah. No spots but wide apart eyes. I think this one is always eyes close together, but then if he has big arms he might be a 2. This guy has eyes wide apart - I think he is either 2 or 4. But because he doesn't have any spots or any other (?) I think like he's just a 2.",27,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:00:36.6),I'll try 2.,27,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:00:42.9),Which one is that one? 1?,28,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:00:44.6),Yeah.,28,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:00:50.7),"Was it also 1, or? Did we have that one?",29,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:00:54.2),"But he must be a 2, right?",29,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:00:56.8),I don't know.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:00:57.2),I think he's a 2.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:00:58.4),Okay let's try.,29,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:01:00.8),So with- if he- without spots he would be a 1.,30,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:01:04.2),Hmm...,30,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:01:04.3),But with spots he was a 2. And this guy has his arms raised which means he's not down here. I think he's a 3.,30,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:01:14.1),"Or a 4, no? Why 3?",30,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:01:16.8),Because first we thought that he would be a 4.,30,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:01:19.9),Uh.,30,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:01:20.4),No no he has-,30,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:01:21.0),He needs blue.,30,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:01:21.4),-eyes wide apart. Um. So. No you're right. Let's try 4.,30,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:01:27.1),Okay.,30,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:01:29.7),If he has eyes close together I think he would be a 3.,31,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:01:31.7),Mm.,31,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:01:32.2),"Regardless of the spots or not. And he's a 1, right?",31,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:01:36.6),I think so yeah.,31,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:01:41.2),"Nothing changes with the teeth, does it? It's always the same teeth, right?",32,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:01:46.7),I actually didn't-,32,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:01:48.8),Cause they always have these like two ginormous fangs.,32,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:01:51.3),Ah.,32,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:01:52.0),Yeah like really dangerous. I think that's the same though.,32,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:01:55.1),Yeah I think so.,32,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:02:02.1),I think he's still a 1.,33,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:02:03.3),Okay.,33,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:02:05.6),Nutricious. Okay why? Maybe...,34,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:02:09.7),I don't know. Because he was green or had spots or both.,34,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:02:14.4),Yeah.,34,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:02:14.5),Is he a 3 or?,34,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:02:16.4),Maybe 3. I think he's 3. Cause last time with spots was 4.,34,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:02:20.5),Right.,34,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:02:20.5),So maybe 3.,34,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:02:22.3),Yeah.,34,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:02:28.3),"He's a 2, right? I think he's a 2 - arms down, no spots, no nothing. I think he just has jelly in him.",35,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:02:36.3),Okay let's try.,35,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:02:44.8),3 or 4 I'm thinking.,36,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:02:45.4),Um. Is that the 1?,36,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:02:49.1),Oh you're thinking 1?,36,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:02:50.3),"Yeah. There was like one of them that totally confused us, and I think it might be that one.",36,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:02:52.4),Yeah! Mm. I'm gonna try (?).,36,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:02:55.8),But maybe it was only in blue.,36,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:02:59.1),I don't remember.,36,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:03:00.5),"I think it's either 1 or 4, right?",36,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:03:02.9),Mm.,36,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:03:03.3),"And I think we had it in- I think we might have had it in blue, and it was 1. I don't remember if the green one also is 1. I think it's 4.",36,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:03:11.7),Or if blue is 4 and maybe this one is 1. We can try.,36,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:03:15.6),Yeah let's try that and then we'll figure it out.,36,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:03:18.9),"It was a 3... But he was with spots. But this guy has eyes further apart, so he must be a 4.",37,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:03:27.9),4. Yeah. I'd also say 4.,37,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:03:34.7),Okay that one we just had. He's a 3. That was the one we just had.,38,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:03:39.5),Mm-hmm.,38,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:03:39.9),Yeah.,38,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:03:42.7),"I don't get it. Is there like a characteristic that we haven't noticed at all? I'm pretty sure he's a 1 though, right?",39,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:03:56.6),Yeah I'm thinking the-,39,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:04:06.0),And he's a 4. Cause his eyes are wide apart. Right?,40,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:04:09.3),"Wasn't it blue? I'm not sure. I think maybe he's a 2, no?",40,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:04:17.8),But he has the big arms.,40,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:04:20.6),I'm not sure. Um. Okay.,40,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:04:33.3),I think he's a 4.,40,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:04:34.4),Okay let's try 4.,40,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:04:37.1),So if his eyes were close together it's a different thing.,41,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:04:41.4),Hmm.,41,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:04:41.7),And he's a 2. I'm pretty sure.,41,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:04:50.8),I think he's also a-,42,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:04:51.6),One. Two?,42,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:04:52.2),No I think he's a 2.,42,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:04:53.8),"Okay, let's see.",42,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:05:00.7),I think that one's 4.,43,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:05:01.7),No he's a 1.,43,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:05:02.6),One?,43,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:05:03.0),Yeah that was the one that completely messed with us. I think he is a 1.,43,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:05:07.0),Okay let's try.,43,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:05:19.5),"He's a 2, right?",44,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:05:20.7),Hmm.... I'm not sure anymore!,44,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:05:22.8),This is just completely guessing.,44,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:05:24.7),Okay 2.,44,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:05:31.3),I think it's 1.,45,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:05:32.5),Go ahead.,45,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:05:38.0),Same thing.,46,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:05:38.6),Yeah. 1.,46,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:05:45.2),"Also 1, right?",47,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:05:45.7),Um... Yeah I guess.,47,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:05:54.6),Yeah that's the one that-,48,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:05:54.7),Four. Or maybe that one is just nutricious?,48,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:06:00.4),I have no idea.,48,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:06:01.5),Okay I'll try 2.,48,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:06:11.3),"And he's a 1, right? He must be the 1.",49,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:06:14.9),Yeah that's right.,49,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:06:16.6),"And he was without spots. But big arms. Not just raised, but also muscle arms.",50,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:06:20.5),(?) spots?,50,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:06:23.3),What? No without spots. He was without spots.,50,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:06:25.2),Yeah-yeah-yeah. And I'm thinking I- with spots (?) was it the nutricious one.,50,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:06:28.7),"That could be. That could be yeah. And he's a 3, right?",50,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:06:33.3),I'm not sure. I don't know. Okay let's try 3.,50,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:06:38.0),He was a 2. But he was without spots.,51,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:06:40.4),"So maybe arms up kinda- arms up, wide eyes, it means 2.",51,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:06:47.1),But he had eyes further apart.,51,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:06:49.8),Yeah-yeah-yeah.,51,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:06:50.0),"Yeah no that's what you said. Yeah, right.",51,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:06:52.4),Maybe that's 2.,51,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:06:52.9),"That must be it, yeah.",51,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:06:55.3),So this is 1.,51,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:06:56.8),"He's a 1, yeah.",51,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:07:03.0),He's a 4. Isn't he? What were you gonna say?,52,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:07:06.9),I was gonna say 2. I'm not sure anymore.,52,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:07:10.5),You can try 2.,52,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:07:11.1),"Because without spots- we just had one, it was 2.",52,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:07:14.2),Yeah. Yeah.,52,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:07:15.1),I'm not sure what the spots mean.,52,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:07:15.7),But I think- that's what I think- the spots means that it's-,52,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:07:19.4),-dangerous.,52,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:07:19.9),Dangerous. Yeah.,52,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:07:20.8),Okay let's try yours. Yeah maybe I think you might be right.,52,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:07:25.8),Okay so regardless of spots...,53,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:07:28.0),Mm. Arms up.,53,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:07:29.4),Okay.,53,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:07:30.3),Yeah arms up that must be the thing.,53,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:07:32.1),Mm.,53,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:07:32.6),Right? Okay.,53,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:07:33.8),Which one would you guess?,53,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:07:36.1),I would probably guess a 2.,53,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:07:39.3),I'll say 3.,53,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:07:39.8),Three?,53,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:07:40.7),I'm not sure.,53,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:07:41.6),Just kill him then. Take no chances.,53,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:07:45.4),He was a 1?,54,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:07:46.2),"Why? He was with spots, he was arms down, where was his eyes? Normal?",54,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:07:52.3),"I don't know. He's- he's still a 1, right?",54,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:08:04.0),I think yeah.,54,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:08:04.7),"Wide arms, no spots.",54,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:08:06.0),And his eyes are not angry. If it was he was 2.,54,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:08:08.1),Yeah. Yeah.,54,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:08:09.1),Okay let's try.,54,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:08:16.0),Maybe that one's 1?,55,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:08:18.6),Two.,55,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:08:19.0),Two?,55,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:08:19.4),Yeah.,55,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:08:20.0),Why 2?,55,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:08:21.0),Um... I think only the eyes close together was a 1. And I don't think the eyes wide apart was a 1.,55,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:08:27.4),Okay let's try.,55,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:08:33.3),So you think it's 2?,56,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:08:33.5),"Also 2, yeah.",56,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:08:35.7),Okay he was to be ignored. So he was blue.,57,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:08:39.7),And was he spots or without spots?,57,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:08:41.8),Um... He was without spots.,57,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:08:44.1),Mm.,57,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:08:45.0),But eyes wide apart. And he was still a 1.,57,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:08:49.7),I'm getting confused.,57,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:08:50.5),I have no idea anymore. Okay that guy...,57,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:08:54.6),One?,57,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:08:56.8),Yeah. Let's try 1.,57,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:09:03.8),"Yeah no that was the guy we just had... um... What was it? He was a 3, right?",58,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:09:12.3),Maybe 2? No?,58,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:09:14.0),Try 2.,58,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:09:14.6),Okay let's try.,58,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:09:28.2),Four? Because if it was wide eyes it would be 2.,59,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:09:33.2),Mm. Yeah.,59,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:09:34.9),I don't know.,59,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:09:35.4),I think he's 1 or 4. But maybe because he's with spots he's a 4.,59,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:09:41.8),Okay let's try.,59,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:09:48.2),"He's a 1, right?",60,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:09:49.1),Yeah.,60,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:09:55.8),"A still 1, right?",61,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:09:56.7),Mm.,61,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:10:05.4),"So this guy without spots, but arms raised, is he then the 1? Or is he a 3? I think maybe he's a 1.",62,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:10:12.4),Yeah I think he's 1.,62,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:10:15.3),Cause he has no spots.,62,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:10:18.8),He's still a 3.,63,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:10:20.6),"Without spots, arms up.",63,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:10:25.4),And eyes close together.,63,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:10:30.4),He's a- he's a-,63,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:10:31.0),A 2.,63,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:10:31.7),Two?,63,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:10:32.2),I'm pretty sure he's a 2.,63,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,A,(1:10:39.9),He's a 2.,64,Rebekka R
Pair16,3,B,(1:10:41.1),Okay let's try.,64,Rebekka R
